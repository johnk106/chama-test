# Edit Member Functionality Fixes

## Issues Identified and Fixed

### Issue 1: No Event Response on Edit Button Click
**Problem**: Clicking the edit button had no response due to function availability issues.

**Root Cause**: 
- Functions were defined in external JS file but may not have been loaded properly
- Functions were not properly exposed to the global scope
- Event listeners were not properly set up for the edit modal

**Fixes Applied**:

1. **Inline Function Definition**: Moved edit member functions directly into the HTML template for immediate availability:
   ```javascript
   window.openEditMemberModal = function(memberId) { ... }
   window.closeEditMemberModal = function() { ... }
   window.submitEditMember = function(event) { ... }
   ```

2. **Enhanced Data Attributes**: Added comprehensive data attributes to member cards:
   ```html
   data-member-id="{{ member.id }}" 
   data-member-name="{{ member.name }}"
   data-member-email="{{ member.email }}"
   data-member-mobile="{{ member.mobile }}"
   data-member-id-number="{{ member.member_id|default:'' }}"
   data-member-role="{{ member.role.name|default:'member' }}"
   data-member-role-id="{{ member.role.id|default:'' }}"
   ```

3. **Event Listener Setup**: Added proper event listeners for:
   - Edit modal click-outside-to-close
   - Edit form submission
   - Keyboard ESC key to close modal

### Issue 2: Modal Not Displaying
**Problem**: Edit modal was not showing when button was clicked.

**Fixes Applied**:

1. **Direct DOM Manipulation**: Used direct `style.display` changes instead of relying on CSS classes:
   ```javascript
   document.getElementById('adminEditMemberModal').style.display = 'block';
   ```

2. **Form Pre-population**: Implemented proper form field population:
   ```javascript
   document.getElementById('editMemberName').value = memberName;
   document.getElementById('editMemberEmail').value = memberEmail;
   // ... etc for all fields
   ```

3. **Role Selection**: Added proper role dropdown selection:
   ```javascript
   const roleSelect = document.getElementById('editMemberRole');
   if (memberRoleId) {
       roleSelect.value = memberRoleId;
   }
   ```

### Issue 3: Form Submission Not Working
**Problem**: Form submission was not sending data to backend properly.

**Fixes Applied**:

1. **AJAX Request Structure**: Implemented proper AJAX submission:
   ```javascript
   fetch('/chamas-bookeeping/edit-member/', {
       method: 'POST',
       headers: {
           'X-CSRFToken': getCsrfToken(),
           'Content-Type': 'application/json',
       },
       body: JSON.stringify(memberData)
   })
   ```

2. **Error Handling**: Added comprehensive error handling and user feedback:
   ```javascript
   .then(data => {
       if (data.status === 'success') {
           showAlert(data.message, 'success');
           window.closeEditMemberModal();
           setTimeout(() => location.reload(), 1000);
       } else {
           showAlert(data.message || 'Failed to update member', 'error');
       }
   })
   .catch(error => {
       showAlert('Error updating member: ' + error.message, 'error');
   })
   ```

3. **Loading States**: Added loading indicators during submission:
   ```javascript
   submitBtn.textContent = 'Updating...';
   submitBtn.disabled = true;
   ```

### Issue 4: Backend Edit Service
**Problem**: Backend service needed proper admin verification and validation.

**Implementation**:

1. **Admin Permission Check**:
   ```python
   requesting_user_membership = ChamaMember.objects.get(
       user=request.user, 
       group=chama, 
       active=True
   )
   if not requesting_user_membership.role or requesting_user_membership.role.name != 'admin':
       return JsonResponse({
           'status': 'failed',
           'message': 'Only admin users can edit member details'
       }, status=403)
   ```

2. **Data Validation**: Added comprehensive validation for all fields
3. **User Linking**: Implemented user linking/unlinking via ID numbers
4. **Duplicate Prevention**: Prevents duplicate emails/phones in same chama

## Current Functionality

### For Admin Users:
1. **Click Edit Button**: Orange edit button appears next to member actions
2. **Modal Opens**: Pre-populated form with current member data

4. **Submit Changes**: Real-time validation and AJAX submission
5. **Success/Error Messages**: Clear feedback on operation status
6. **Auto Refresh**: Page refreshes to show updated data

### Security Features:
1. **Role Verification**: Only admin users can access edit functionality
2. **CSRF Protection**: All requests include CSRF tokens

4. **Active Member Check**: Only active members can perform operations
